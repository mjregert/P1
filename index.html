            I am a husband and father of two boys. Both my wife and I are originally from Colorado, just outside of the
            Boulder area (near the foothills of the Rocky Mountains). We moved to Texas in 2000 after I graduated from
            the University of Colorado with a degree in Computer Science Engineering.

            I am former leader with the Boy Scouts of America and love camping and outdoor photography. I love music
            and love listening to vinyl records.  My favorite band is Def Leppard and have been able to see them
            three times in concert including the filming of their Hysteria music videos filmed in Denver, Colorado!
            I have three dogs, Shyann (a lab/husky mix), Lexie (a spaniel mix), and Miley (a chihuahua).
